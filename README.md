## Possible questions to I want to answer

- [Which coding standards used](#which-coding-standarts-used)
- [Why composer phar needed](#why-composer-phar-needed)

### Which coding standards used

We are using [Inpsyde PHP Coding Standards](https://github.com/inpsyde/php-coding-standards). Because I want to show how much I can follow company rules. 


### Why composer phar needed

If you try to install `Inpsyde PHP Coding Standards` with composer2, you will get compability error.That's why I downloaded latest composer1 and include to project.
